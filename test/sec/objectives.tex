\section{Objectives}
The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of accurately identifying and classifying crop diseases through automated means. Crop diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, leading to economic losses and threats to food security. This project aims to provide a technological solution to mitigate these issues.

The specific goals of this project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developing a machine learning model capable of classifying crop diseases using a dataset of approximately 17,000 images.
    \item Improving the speed and accuracy of crop disease detection compared to manual diagnosis.
    \item Reducing the dependency on expert intervention by providing farmers with an accessible and user-friendly diagnostic tool.
    \item Enhancing agricultural management practices by enabling early detection and targeted treatment of diseases.
    \item Contributing to sustainable agricultural development by minimizing crop losses and improving yield quality.
\end{itemize}

The intended outcome of this project is a robust, reliable, and scalable system that can assist agricultural stakeholders in efficiently managing crop health, ultimately supporting global food security.
