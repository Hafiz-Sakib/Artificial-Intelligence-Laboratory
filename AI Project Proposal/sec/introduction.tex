\section{Introduction}
Crop diseases pose a significant challenge to global agriculture, impacting crop yield and food security. Timely and accurate identification of crop diseases is critical for effective management and prevention. With advancements in machine learning and computer vision, automated systems for disease detection have gained considerable attention.

This project focuses on utilizing a dataset of approximately 17,000 images categorized into five distinct classes of crop diseases. By leveraging these images, the project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically classifying and predicting crop diseases. Such a system can assist farmers and agricultural stakeholders in early detection, enabling targeted interventions to mitigate crop loss.

The broader context of this project lies in enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. The use of technology in agriculture has the potential to address challenges such as disease outbreaks, reducing economic losses, and ensuring food security. This proposal outlines the methodology, objectives, and anticipated outcomes, contributing to the intersection of agriculture and artificial intelligence.
