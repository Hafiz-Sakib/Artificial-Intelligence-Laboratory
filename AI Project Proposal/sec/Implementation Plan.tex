\section{Implementation Plan}
This project will be executed in several phases, each focusing on a critical aspect of the crop disease prediction system. The steps and their respective timelines are as follows:

\subsection{Phases of Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Understanding (Week 1–2)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collect publicly available datasets containing images of crop diseases.
        \item Analyze the dataset structure, distribution, and class balance.
        \item Supplement the dataset with synthetic data using data augmentation techniques if required.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing (Week 3–4)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Standardize image dimensions by resizing.
        \item Normalize pixel values for consistent input across the model.
        \item Remove noisy or irrelevant data and handle class imbalance using augmentation.
        \item Split the dataset into training (70\%), validation (15\%), and test (15\%) subsets.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Model Selection and Training (Week 5–8)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluate various machine learning models, focusing on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
        \item Train selected models on the preprocessed dataset using GPUs for faster computation.
        \item Fine-tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to optimize performance.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Model Testing and Evaluation (Week 9–10)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
        \item Conduct error analysis to identify common misclassifications and refine the model.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{System Deployment (Week 11–12)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.
        \item Integrate the trained model into the system for real-time crop disease detection.
        \item Test the deployed system in a simulated or real-world environment to ensure reliability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
